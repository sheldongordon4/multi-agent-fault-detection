    "text": "This is a local demo ticket for scenario 'overload_trip' on bus_1. The anomaly detector analyzed 3600 points, found 329 anomaly windows, and produced a mean anomaly score of None. Based on this run, the ticket severity is classified as **high**. No external LLM was called; this ticket was generated purely from the local detector summary to exercise the end-to-end MVP pipeline (detector \u2192 ticket \u2192 Streamlit UI).",
