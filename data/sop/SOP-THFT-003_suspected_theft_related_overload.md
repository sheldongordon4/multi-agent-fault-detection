TITLE: Suspected Theft-Related Overload on Distribution Feeders
SECTION: 5.4 Non-Technical Loss and Overload Investigation
URL: https://internal.example/sops/suspected_theft_related_overload

This SOP describes how to investigate overload conditions that may be associated with
unauthorized connections, energy theft, or other non-technical losses on distribution feeders.

Conditions:
- Persistent high loading on a feeder without corresponding increases in billed demand.
- Overloads occurring primarily during specific periods that do not align with known customer behavior.
- SCADA data showing irregular load patterns, sudden step changes, or high load in areas
  with a history of theft.

Trip Criteria:
- Overload alarms or trips on feeders serving regions with known theft issues.
- Repeated overload events that do not correlate with legitimate customer growth or weather patterns.

Operator Actions:
1. Confirm the overload condition using SCADA trends and compare with historical loading.
2. Cross-check feeder loading with billing and metering data to identify discrepancies.
3. Notify the non-technical loss or revenue protection team to initiate a field investigation.
4. Where safe and permitted, reconfigure load or adjust switching to reduce stress on the
   affected feeder while investigations proceed.
5. Record all observations, including times, loading patterns, and any field reports of
   unauthorized connections.
6. After corrective actions in the field, monitor the feeder loading to confirm that overload
   conditions have been resolved.

Notes:
- Field investigations for theft must follow legal, regulatory, and safety requirements.
- Coordination with revenue protection, legal, and law enforcement teams may be required.
