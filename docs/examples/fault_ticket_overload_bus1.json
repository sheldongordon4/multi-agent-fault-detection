    "Verify feeder loading and confirm whether current is above normal operating limits.",
    "Review recent operational changes or load transfers on the affected feeder.",
    "Consult the cited SOP and confirm that relay settings match the latest coordination study.",
    "If overload conditions persist, coordinate with planning/protection engineering for longer-term mitigation."
